# From Scratch AV Roulette

- Working with your randomly assigned partner, you'll have one hour to make a 3-5 min From Scratch AV LiveCoding set in flok with miniTidalStrudel and hydra.

- After the hour, you'll present your work, then will submit documentation of the project and process by the end of the day.

- Documentation as always reflects what you did, how you did it, problems you faced, sources you used, etc in MarkDown as a .md. Also include information about the collaboration process.
