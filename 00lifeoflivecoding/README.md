# The Life of Live Coding

## DTR: Live Coding
- Live coding is a performance approach where a creative coder demonstrably writes and rewrites art-making protocols in real-time
  - Audio - Visual Digital media (mostly)
  - [Dance](https://vimeo.com/916916243), Poetry, Lighting design (more and more)
- With <3 to controllerism, this is not controllerism
  - When we re-write the rules, we change their fundamental character, not just their behavior
    - Like adapting a recipe with different ingredients vs adjusting serving size
  - If controller and sound source are divorced, how the rules are being re-written in real-time is obscured
  - Chaos reigns, not control!

## Where we're coming from?
- [The Hub](https://acousmata.com/post/893801464/martian-folk-music)
- [George Lewis](https://brahms.ircam.fr/en/media/xd2cc9d)
- [Laurie Spiegel](https://teropa.info/musicmouse/)

## Ethos
- Luthier/developer/backend, performer/musician/frontend roles blurred/blended = Distributed Agency
- Anti-hierarchical
- Relatively low barriers to access (FOSS technologies)
  - Economically accessible ("The Laptop is the Guitar of the 21st Century" - Fred Frith)
  - Pedagogically accessible (with many, many caveats)
- TOPLAP (virtual gatheringplace for livecoders) MANIFESTO (the Rachel edit):
* Give us access to the performer’s mind, to the whole human instrument.
* Obscurantism is dangerous. Show us your screens…
* Embrace error, risk is the way to go. Live coding embraces worst practices.
* Code is an interface to oneself, and the self is an interface to culture. To code is to decode.
* Programming and programmer are both part of the runtime environment.
* We weave expression through algorithms that thrive in uncertainty.
* To hack is to play seriously. Rules are good because they can be changed.

## Who am I?
- Improviser (hornist with sf nowave, sludge bands after conservatory)
- Came to technology through an interest information accessibility (adult literacy tutor, public and corrections librarian)
- <3 for Network Music and its anti-hierarchical structures
- mind blown by the last [The HUB](http://crossfade.walkerart.org/brownbischoff/) concerts
- Affords criticality of our relationship to digital capitalism
- Started SuperColliding in 2011, making noise to improvise against on my horn
- Moved Paris in 2015 without my horn, Laptop became my primary instrument
- Joined UK-based offal [orchestra for femmes and laptops] in 2016
- Started teaching livecoding here in 2021
	- natalie, jame, jade 2022
- livecode.boston started in 2024

## Who are you?

## What do you know about Live Coding? Why are you here?

## What are we going to do here and how are we going to do it?
- Big Picture (audio then visual, then both)
- Nitty Gritty (the syllabus)

### THE TWO GitHub REPOSITORIES OF THIS CLASS
- One to share my materials with you **(343)**
- One to share your materials with me **(lc)**

## For next week:
  - Clone the **343** Repository
  - Setup your **lc** Repository
  - [The Discord](https://discord.gg/p3mxpjY3)
  - Reading: ["LiveCoding: A User's Manual" pp.1-8 (chapter one *before* "navigating this book")](https://static.livecodingbook.toplap.org/books/livecoding.pdf)
  - Writing: a .md file in your lc repository outlining *two* things that were new to you/surprised to you in the reading and *two* things that were not new to you/didn't surprise you in the reading.
  - Hand it in via Github.com+Canvas as outlined in the syllabus!
  - BRING HEADPHONES!!!
